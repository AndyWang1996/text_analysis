Sue Petrow said she and other guests had refused to pay extra charges demanded by the hotel.
Holidaymakers like Sue may have paid for their rooms and meals months in advance, but hotels would normally only receive the money from Thomas Cook several weeks after their stay.
Reports suggested there was widespread concern in Cuba over whether the industry insurance fund Atol, which covers payments in the event of a firm failing, would foot the costs.
The fund covers bills that have been run up since Thomas Cook's collapse on Monday morning.
However, bills run up at hotels before Thomas Cook's collapse will not be covered. Affected hoteliers will have to apply to the liquidators for their money.
Counting costs
Dame Deirdre said the CAA had issued guarantees for payment to 3,000 hotels around the world, and had already started making the first payments. The CAA had 200 staff working with Thomas Cook employees, she added.
"Given how much those hotels are owed by Thomas Cook, it's hardly surprising that they are suspicious and angry", she said.
Thomas Cook owes hotels ¡ê338m, with one hotel in Mexico owed ¡ê2.5m, she added.
The Insolvency Service has written to local tourist boards to make sure hotels are working with the C.A.A. on payments, Dame Hutton said.
